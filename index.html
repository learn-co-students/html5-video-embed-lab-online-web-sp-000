  <!--controls attribute present. This is required to display the controls to start and pause playback, adjust the recording's
   volume, etc. There are optional attributes you can provide such as autoplay and loop.
  These start the audio/video on page load, rather than waiting for a user to click play and repeat the audio after it ends.
  The width and height attributes set the size of the video. Without them, the video element may flicker while the page
  is loading.The source tag is only ever used for multiple media resources, as we have in our example.
  The src attribute of source is always required, as it is the path to the file we want to play.
  The type tag is helpful in defining what format the media is in. 
  When wi don't have multiple sources:
  <video src="videofile.ogg" autoplay poster="posterimage.jpg"></video> -->

      <video controls autoplay width="600px" height="400px" >
        <source src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/skills-front-end-web-development/real-estate-lab-assets/real-estate.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        <source src=" https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/skills-front-end-web-development/real-estate-lab-assets/real-estate.ogg" type="video/ogg">
      </video>
